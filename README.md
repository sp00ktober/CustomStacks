# CustomStacks
Mod for the game "Starsand" which just came out on steam in early access.
## What does it do?
Gives you the ability to adjust the maximum stack sizes of items. Currently only one max valua for all items possible but i may add functionality to tune this finer.

It will only change the max stack size of items which have a vanilla stack size of more than 1 (so no axes, pickaxes etc.)

## How does it work?
### Using a Mod Manager
Install either [Thunderstore Mod Manager](https://www.overwolf.com/app/Thunderstore-Thunderstore_Mod_Manager) or [r2modman](https://thunderstore.io/package/ebkr/r2modman/) and install the mod from there.
### Manual Installation
You can follow the steps in the [BepInEx Docs](https://docs.bepinex.dev/articles/user_guide/installation/index.html) to setup BepInEx and then download [the release](https://github.com/sp00ktober/CustomStacks/releases) and copy it into your plugins folder.

The default increased stack size is 99 but you can change that in the corresponding config file which will be created after the first game boot with this mod installed.
